MatchAnnot is easy to install. The package includes top-level
executable python scripts, and supporting python modules. All of those
reside in a single python directory. All you need to do is download
the MatchAnnot .zip file from github and unzip it, to create a
directory called MatchAnnot-master containing the scripts and modules.

The executable scripts (currently including matchAnnot.py and
clusterView.py) should be findable via the $PATH environment
variable, e.g.:

    export PATH=$PATH:~/MatchAnnot-master

They can then be run from the command line. The modules they require
will be found automatically, because they reside in the same
directory.

Try running with the --help option to see what command line parameters
are available.

If the magic as described here doesn't work for you, please let me know.
